My name is Craig Penfold. I'm a Fractional CTO, a CTO, a VP of Engineering, and a Chief Product Officer. I love all things about technology and solving real customer problems.

Outside of work, I love music - playing in bands, listening to music, and seeing live gigs, I love playing golf (handicap of 30). I have two kids aged 19 and 17, a schnoodle dog and a wife of 23 years.
