My name is Craig Penfold. I'm a Fractional CTO, a CTO, a VP of Engineering, and a Chief Product Officer. I love all things about technology and solving real customer problems.

I'm a coach, an advisor, and a non-executive director. I'm available for working in a remote hybrid environment, or in Sydney and Melbourne.

I focus on building great leaders, then operationalising them to create high performing teams

Outside of work, I love music - playing in bands, listening to music, and seeing live gigs, I love playing golf (handicap of 30). I have two kids aged 19 and 17, a schnoodle dog and a wife of 23 years. I also love the Sydney Swans in the AFL and the Cronulla Sharks in the NRL
